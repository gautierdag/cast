Across the foreground of the frame is a chain link fence. It is perfectly aligned horizontally with the gravel in front of the train tracks. Through the chain link fence is a grassy field. Across the top half of the frame and above the engine car is a blue sky with wispy white cirrus clouds.", "description_1": "An outdoor medium long shot three-quarter front left side view of a long train traveling from right to left. The train starts with a black engine car that consists of white numbers underneath the operator window that read \"7676\". The black engine is pulling many multi-colored train cars behind it. The railroad track that the train is traveling on is placed on a small mound made up of gray colored rocks. The area to the right of the railroad track is a green grass field, and rooted into the field is a silver metal caged fence. The light blue sky that consists of a few white puffy clouds can be seen above the train."}
