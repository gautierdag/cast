It has faded red metal bands with horizontal equal spaces between them. This grate is divided by four equal vertical bands. A large sign of the text,\"EDUCATION\" runs across the frame. It is one third of the way up from the bottom of the image. The text is in bold white, with serifs. The letters are mounted separately over the grate. Behind the grate with the text, across the top third of the frame, is a horizontal dull silver metal grate. One vertical band of metal runs down from the top right to behind the faded red grate. Across the bottom of the image, and under the sign, there is a round tree top shadow.",
