The moon is reflecting sunlight, giving it a bright yellow glow. The actual moon isn't visible because the yellow glow is covering the entire surface of the moon. A halo effect is surrounding the moon. A thin circular swirl of transparent clouds is on top of the moon. A cluster of white stars is visible on the right side of the frame. Two white stars are visible on the left end of the frame. The night sky is a dull gray.", "description_1": "A worm's eye view of the bright white sun, and along the edges of the sun there are orange markings.
