  "description_0": "An outdoor daytime view of a large shadow on a tennis court. The shadow is of the utility lighting fixture that goes over the courts for night matches. The shadow has eight boxes of light fixtures that are attached to two crossbars off of one pole. The top two boxes are rectangular shape and paired together at the top middle center of the frame. The crossbars run vertical and parallel in the center of the frame. The next two boxes of light fixtures are on each side of the pole. The shadows of them are rectangles with curved backs toward the crossbars. The next two shadows down the crossbar are beneath the main pole shadow. They are squares on each side of the crossbars they are attached to. The final two light fixtures at the bottom are above the center of the middle bottom edge. The one on the right is a box. The one on the left is a rectangle with curved back shadow that faces up toward the top right corner. Across the top right corner and angled from left to the middle of the right edge is a chain link fence. From the top right corner to the lower right edge is the shadow of the chain link fence. The shadows are all over an illuminated light green court surface.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor frontal view of a white stone fireplace with four black metal screen doors. The remaining of a burnt log and black and white ashes are scattered throughout the inside of the fireplace. The white bricks above the fireplace have a dark reddish tint from previous fires. A long horizontal wooden beam is partially visible mounted above the fireplace. Bright sunlight and the shadows of thin intertwined objects are falling down onto the visible surfaces. A great concrete floor begins at the base of the fireplace and continues in foreground towards the camera."
