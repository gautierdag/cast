  "description_0": "A long-shot view of grass and mountains in the far distance. On the near side of the view, a small portion of a black road can be seen, and to the left of this road there is a small amount of green grass that seems partially maintained. Along this part of the grass, there are three wooden posts that have been inserted into the ground and run vertically. There is one in the middle, one on the right, and another on the left. Connected to each post are three metal wires that run horizontally. Behind the post in the middle and a little behind, there is a single tree that is green. Behind the green grass is a forest that is filled with dark green trees, only the top portion of these trees is visible. Behind the forest there is a mountain that is tall, and behind this mountain there is another that is slightly smaller and stretches further back. The top points of the mountains are being covered by white clouds that are low. The sky is covered with a large gray cloud, and underneath this cloud there are white clouds. It is daytime, as everything can be seen clearly.",

On the near side of the tall blades of grass, there is maintained grass that is dark green. Behind the grass land, a dark green forest can be seen. All throughout the forest, there are tall and short trees, some of these trees are dark, while others are light green. Behind the forest, many mountains can be seen, the left side is darker, while the right side is partially visible because it's further away. The clouds in the sky are light gray, while the ones above the mountains are darker. It is daytime, as everything can be seen clearly."
