The bottom half of the oval has four encircled stars of Texas that are evenly spaced out, and the top half of the oval has three encircled stars of Texas that are also evenly spaced out. At the bottom of the rock wall is a patch of green grass.", "description_1": "A front view of a single tree in the middle of a green field. It is covered in shadows and is dark. It is full of branches and leaves and then becomes thinner and sticks straight up with a curve in it to the left. Part of an old, tall, broken-off tree stump is on the left of it. Some tall grass and weeds are on the right. A thin wire fence is barely visible going across behind the tree. It has old wood posts spread far apart by the wire. The green field behind the tree is lined with trees farther back. A black electric wire can be seen in the sky going across. The sky is cloudy and light blue."}
