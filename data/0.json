  "description_0": "A medium-close-up view of a yellow Porsche Cayenne parking in front of a large concrete planter that has blooming flowers of red, purple, and deep violet. The Porsche has a roof rack, on which two silver bars extend horizontally across the roof. The sun is reflecting brightly on the hood of the car near the left headlight, and the shadow of the vehicle is falling mostly under the vehicle, extending towards the left. Behind and to the right, a black SUV-style vehicle is parked, and the reflection of the yellow car is visible on the side. In the center of the background, a tree with a large green, leafy canopy is casting shade over two vehicles parked behind the Porsche.",
