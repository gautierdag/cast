The triangles are arranged in two parallel vertical columns of 3 with a single triangle placed in between two columns. The triangles at the bottom of both columns are placed pointed upwards, the rest of the triangles are pointing down. The triangles in the right column are spaced far apart. The triangles in the left column are grouped closer together. A white chalk horizontal line is visible between the top and center triangles in the left column. The lights are turned on.", "description_1": "A view up of a black lighting system that has many bars connected with white led light bulbs on it. The bulbs are attached to a small black bar that comes off of the connected bars. All the lights are lit up, and behind them a white textured ceiling is visible.
