The bird is a gray and white color and is facing towards the left of the image. Small ripples are in the water and the reflection of the bird is reflecting off of the water's surface. Small debris are in the water to the right of the image.", "description_1": "A high-angle view of the top of the head and back of an alligator protruding from the surface of a body of water. The alligator is facing the top right corner of the image. The very top scales of the alligator's back and head are dry, the lower scales that are still above the water are visibly wet. The water isn't particularly transparent, but the right legs and the tail of the alligator are visible just under the surface of the water. The surface of the water is relatively calm with consistent small ripples throughout the image. Sunlight is reflecting off of the ripples in the water. The water appears to be a dark brackish color."}
