The window has multiple streaks of rain, with no discernible droplets, giving the window and frame a warped look. The street is at its front view, with multiple palm trees on each side of the road, as well as cars parked on the curbs. A large tan building is to the left side of the road, with tall pillars and dark windows, and to the right is a smaller building with an arching roof. The rain makes it hard to show smaller details of the objects in the frame. The sky is a light gray, cloudy area, with soft nimbostratus clouds.", "description_1": "A stop sign is seen next to a tall privacy wall on the right while the rain comes down. The scene is viewed from the other side of a window. The window shows water softly running down the glass, obscuring the image. There are white dots of rain falling across the image, as seen in front of the dark green trees and the red and white stop sign. The beige wall on the right has a thick cream border along the horizontal top and the vertical edge to the right of the stop sign. A street intersection is seen on the left of the stop sign, with a row of greenery ahead and a visible palm tree towards the left. On the left of the palm tree is a wide, dark green tree. On the right, behind the beige wall, is another palm tree that reaches beyond the top and right edges of the image. Across from the stop sign is another wide, dark green tree. The sky in the scene is a solid gray."}
