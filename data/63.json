  "description_0": "Paper lanterns are seen hanging from a tent-type ceiling with a metal frame. Four of the lanterns are globe-shaped, while the fifth one that hangs behind the bottom left globe is a flattened shape. Both of the globe lanterns on the right are lit up. All but one of the globes have a symmetrical frame. The top right globe has a swirled frame and has two tears on the bottom of the paper. The right bottom lantern has a tear on the side, and the bottom left lantern has a tear on the bottom. The ceiling is black cloth with large metal frame beams. A small blue sign hangs from the metal beam on the left and can only partially be seen in the bottom corner. The sign is a circular shape and reads \"MENUS\" in white.",
  "description_1": "A very large light fixture is seen from a low angle, attached to wood beams on a wood plank ceiling. It has a large black circle base with numerous black cords of different lengths attached. The black cords hold iridescent glass globes with open bottoms. Each globe has a warm-toned round light bulb lit up inside. The ceiling is made of dark wood with small flush-mounted lights. Behind the large light fixture is another large light fixture that is slightly different, with a hanging hollow circular base that has round glass globes attaching to the base with warm light bulbs lit up. Two white brick pillars are seen in the distance in the bottom right of the image."
