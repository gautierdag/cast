The hood is designed with two aerodynamic bends that distort the reflection of the tall leafless tree visible on the glossy paint stretching towards the driver side. The ground to the left of the automobile is covered with light brown gravel. Another leafless tree is partially visible reflecting off of the passenger side windshield. A tree top covered with leaves is visible in the upper right corner of the hood. The white sunlight and clear sky is visible behind the tree in the reflection in the upper left corner of the hood, which gradually fades to blue towards the bottom of the hood.",

Behind the cars roof is a ground floor made up of multi-shaded dark gray bricks that are positioned horizontally and vertically, and placed side by side. To the left of the brick ground floor is another ground floor made up of small multi-colored rocks, the surface has four small plants rooted into it.
