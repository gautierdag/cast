  "description_0": "An outside, medium, eye level view of a silhouette of a man standing up that is cast onto the surface of a grass lawn. The light source is coming from a raised off frame light. There is a cream-colored labradoodle on the right side of the lawn with a plastic cone around its neck, and it is looking down at the ground with its tail sticking out to the right. The dog is facing to the left. There is light shining on the dog. The lawn closer to the bottom of the frame is dried and brown. It is nighttime.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor top-down view of a zebra-tailed lizard with five black stripes across its tail and more faded black stripes above the tail. It has two long black-striped, cream-colored legs with five toes on each foot and two long cream-colored arms. The lizard is looking straight ahead, and the head shadow can be seen to the left of the lizard. The lizard is surrounded by light gray gravel mixed with multiple different-sized rocks. In the bottom right corner, there is the shadow of a person's hand pointing in the left direction, where the lizard is."
