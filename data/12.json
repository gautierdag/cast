  "description_0": "A back medium slightly blurred view of an American Airlines passenger plane at an airport boarding gate area. Below the white plane with its red and blue tail design is numerous amounts of storage, crates, moving equipment, and a white colored truck in the middle right of the view. At the top of the view is a large clouded gray sky. In the near background an airport can be seen with its gate indicated by black signs with white text outside the building. To the left \"A10\" can be seen, in the middle of the view \"A8\" can be seen, and on the right and last gate \"A6\" can be seen. Multiple light poles can be seen extending well above the airport building, none of them turned on yet. The sun isn't shinning but the view is still fairly visible, small shadows can be seen underneath the large plane in the middle of the view.",

The plane is white with text on the side of it. There is a red, white, and blue pattern on the tail of it. There are tree tops with green leaves in the foreground going across the bottom of the image. There is a white and gray building visible directly beneath the sky. The building has rows of rectangular windows with white frames, the walls are slightly discolored and stained in some areas. The sun is shining on the left side of the building."
