  "description_0": "A low-angle view of a tall glass building, with the left side partially visible. The building's facade features a sleek grid pattern of thin window frames, with glass panels stretching to the very edges. Altocumulus clouds reflect across its surface, transforming the building into a mirror of the sky. Above the building, a strip of wispy altocumulus clouds is visible in the blue sky. A metal slated overhang hangs out from the building in the middle. A small portion of clouds on the right are brighter by being illuminated by the sun.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor view of the vast light blue sky, and along the top portion of the sky there are cirrocumulus clouds. The top portion of the sky is darker blue, while the bottom half is light blue. Along the right side of the sky, there are thin cirrocumulus clouds that run vertically and wide. To the right of these clouds there are more that run vertically and towards the right, and underneath this cloud there is another that runs vertically and towards the right, but it is large and wide. Along the right side of the sky and towards the bottom, there are some light gray cumulus clouds that are small."
