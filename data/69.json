  "description_1": "An outdoor view from below shows a basketball backboard and net. Most of the backboard is white, while it also has an orange outline. At the center of the board is an orange square. Placed in front of the square is an orange circle that has a white net attached to it. On the very top portion of the hoop there is a football, the left side of the ball is beginning to fade, while along the middle of the ball there are white lines that run vertically and horizontally. There are five basketball hoops around the park. Surrounding the hoops are trees that are full of green leaves, the leaves are gaping, allowing for the gray clouds and blue sky to stand out more. The sun is shining brightly onto the basketball hoop as well as its surroundings."
