The white text is in plastic letters and spells \"WHAT, TIME? \" and there is a medium-sized gap in between what and time. A light shines on the grey slat wall, causing a white reflection of the light to be at the top middle of the wall. White faded line marks are below the W and to the left. The top mark is a small diagonal line, the middle mark is in the shape of a sideways seven, and the bottom mark is a diagonal line slanted to the right.", "description_1": "An indoor slightly upward angled view of a black painted yin-yang sign mounted onto two horizontal wooden support beams on a white textured wall.
