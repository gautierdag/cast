The person is riding on a skateboard, and has one leg on the board while the other is behind the board. The position of the person and board signifies that the figure is skating to the right. A circle is seen around the figure and board, along with a diagonal line going through it, partially covering the stick person and skate board. To the right of the stick person and board are red words that read \"SKATING AND / SKATEBOARDING / PROHIBITED\". A hole is seen in the concrete to the left of the \"N\" in the word \"SKATING\". A horizontal line that serves as the contraction joint for the sidewalk is seen above the words and label.", "description_1": "A very close view is seen of a small sign on the same post as another barely visible sign in front of an outdoor, grassy location. The sign has a red and black line surrounding it. There is a red rectangle in the top half of the sign with a white \"NO\" below the rectangle are the words \"PETS ALLOWED\" with a black dog image in a red circle with a line through it. The sign above has tiny text with a website and phone number. The background shows a shaded area of grass with fallen leaves. A trail is seen on the right and another on the left. A wood-framed structure is seen in the background on the right. The treeline is seen on the left in the background, where the sunlight hits the trail and grass as well."}
