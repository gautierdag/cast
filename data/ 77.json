The puppy has its head tilted towards the right as it is holding something in its paws that it is chewing. The fluffy fur obscures the view of what is being chewed. The back legs are slightly extended towards the right. The eyes of the puppy are angled slightly downward and mostly obscured by fluffy fur sprouting from between the eyes. The grass around the dog is mostly yellow and dried, with some healthy green blades dispersed throughout, along with dead, dried brown leaves. The background is very out of focus. Along the upper left corner of the background, the side of a white camper trailer parked on a distant street is visible with two large black-tinted windows. To the right, along the background, is the side of a house with white siding panels and the base of a tree that is positioned in front of it covers the upper left corner.", "description_1": "A cream-colored Labradoodle dog is seen lying in the grass on a sunny day. The Labradoodle dog is covered in scruffy medium-length fur in a cream color, while its ears are light tan. The dog faces the bottom left and is seen from an angle slightly above it. The dog lies on its stomach with its mouth open and its tongue hanging out, indicating panting. There is a round green utility cover in the bottom left corner with the letters \"I. C. V.\" on it. Sunlight comes from the upper left, and the dog has created a soft shadow in the grass, which has fallen leaves spreading through the area."}
