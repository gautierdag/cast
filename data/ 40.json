There is a long red lighter sitting on the right arm of the chair. There is a landscaped area around the back of the chair with red mulch and green plants growing in it. There is a part of a wood fence on the left, past the landscaped area. There is a street behind the chair and a couple of houses. The one on the right is dark blue, and the one on the left is light blue.", "description_1": "A high angle close up view of a white sign located in the middle left of the view. The sign is a half stadium in shape and cast a large dark shadow in the bottom middle of the view that extends nearly out of view. The sign reads \" PLEASE / USE / SIDEWALK\", in black text. There is a black border in the shape of the sign outside of the letters but not touching the edge of the sign. At the top and background of the view a concrete surface and sidewalk can be seen. The rest of the view is of the area surrounding the sign on the white painted wooden post, the area is filed with green grass and numerous pebbles. Light illuminates the view from the top, shining on the concrete sidewalk and surface, and on the back of the white sign. There is also another white sign directly behind the clearly visible one in view, on the same exact position on the other side of the wooden post."}
