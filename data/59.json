  "description_0": "A close-up view of a gray tabby cat that is lying on a wood table with its body to the right. Its head is facing forward. Its front left leg is bent back. Its front right leg is stretched out and resting on top of a cardboard box that is next to the wood table. Three red, yellow, green and blue juggling balls are lying in front of the cat on the wood table. The back two balls are side by side and touching the cat. A white wall is in the background behind the cat. To the left, things are covered up with a blanket and a white cloth.",
  "description_1": "Upper-angle, slightly skewed view of a gray tabby cat laying flat, to the right, over a light-brown hardwood floor, with a red toy ball in front of the cat. The cat is laying on its side with its back paws facing forward and its front paws flat on the floor with the soft toy ball in between them. The cat's head is looking ahead with a still expression and ears up, its tail is curved behind on the left. Behind the cat is a gray wall with white baseboards, and a white electrical outlet directly above the cat's head."
