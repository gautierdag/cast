The cucumber is in the middle of the image and is extending toward the bottom left side of the image. There are leaves and green stems extending toward all sides of the image, taking up the majority of the image. There are small white and yellow flowers growing sparingly on the stems of the plant throughout the image. Light is reflecting off of leaves and the top side of the cucumber. A dark brown dirt surface is visible in the bottom right corner of the image.", "description_1": "A view of many small cabbage plants in the ground. They have green and purple sagging leaves on them with purple stems. Brown dirt is on the surrounding ground, with broken acorn pieces mixed in with the dirt. The sun is shining on them, and there are shadows on the ground under them to the left. In the middle, set back a bit, a bright green stake is in the ground. It has a pole connected to it on the right and left sides that extends out to each side. There are shadows on the ground from the poles in the back left and right. More plants can be seen in the ground past the stake. The sun is shining on them."}
