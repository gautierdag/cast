  "description_0": "A view across and looking up at a Central Park fountain pool of the Bethesda Terrace. The fountain is a dark concrete and bronze color. The fountain is two-tiered with a circle of columns forming the base. A female angel with wings that is extending her right hand, faces the viewer and to the left. She is at the top in the center of the large fountain. Water cascades down from all around the bowl at her feet. The bottom tier has a group of smaller sculpted cherubs around it. Water cascades from the angled corners on the larger, bottom bowl. The fountain is in a large circular pool with water lilies growing in it. A pole with a light green banner hanging from it, is behind and to the left of the fountain. A wooded leafy green tree line cascades from the top left to the bottom right. The top of the image has a pure blue cloudless sky.",
  "description_1": "A medium-close-up view of a tree and a lamp post. The trunk of the tree is thin, and only the top half is visible. Growing out of the trunk, five branches can be seen, and all throughout the tree there are black and gray markings. Along the top portion of the tree, yellow-green leaves can be seen. To the left of the tree, there is a white lamp post. Attached to the top portion of the post is a black metal piece; above the piece is a glass cover that protects a light bulb; along the cover there are black lines that run vertically. Through the branches, more trees can be seen; along these trees are yellow-green leaves; some of the leaves are covered in shade while the other leaves are being lit up by the sun. To the right and into the distance, a white house can be seen, and along the house's driveway, there are two vehicles parked. The sky is a baby blue, and there is a large white cloud to the right."
