  "description_0": "Three small tour boats are seen docked close against each other across a small body of water. The boats are wide, with rows of bench seating facing out. The boats each have metal frames with soft white covers over them. Each boat has a shimmering gray-covered engine on the back. The left and right boats have an engine cover with the white text \"150,\" and the middle boat has the text \"250\" in white. The right boat has the front of the cover pulled up like an open flap above it. A light post in front of the middle boat shows a small, light green animated alligator holding a tan sign in its right hand. A small dock is barely visible in front of the boats, with a thick line of tall trees behind it. The water in the foreground shows long ripples growing towards the boats and is a murky brown color. The sky behind the trees is bright blue with small white clouds. The sun shines brightly as the boats create small shadows below themselves.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor backside view of two tour boats placed side by side that are docked in front of a cement bank, the water they are floating on is murky and colored brown. Both of the boats are rectangularly shaped, have a white roof, and both have metal silver railings. The boat on the left has a gray colored motor that has white letters on it that read \"150\", and the boat on the right has a gray motor with white letters on it that reads \"250\". Behind the docked boats is a tree line consisting of tall trees with light green leaves, the trees take up the entire top view and span from left to right. The light blue and partly cloudy sky can be seen in between the gaps of the trees."
