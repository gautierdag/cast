Behind the bench there is a dog and turtle sculpture with small plant pots in the soil behind it with some blue flowers. You can see a part of another bench to the right side of it. The sun is casting a shadow on the ground below the dog.", "description_1": "A downward view of the sky covered in white clouds that obscure the sun; there are two dark gray cumulus clouds, a small one on the left and a larger one towards the right, that separate slightly at the top and are mostly obscuring the sun. Behind the cumulus clouds are altocumulus clouds that stretch across the sky in a rough pattern, separating in some areas to reveal the deep blue sky. Below the sky, a line of trees is visible that dips down towards the left side to create an opening. The scene has high contrast and low exposure, making the sunlight very bright and the trees as dark as shadows."}
