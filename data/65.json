  "description_0": "A high-angle close-up shot of two black beetles stacked on top of each other on top of a person's closed fist. Both beetles are centered in the frame, and they are on top of the upper part of the middle and index fingers that are folded. The skin of the hand is brown, with a lighter beige and a pink hue on the palm. The background partly covers the whole frame, with each side showing an out-of-focus background, to the left is gray, and to the right is a red background. The beetle that is stacked on top is using its legs to drip on to the lower beetle, and they both face the right side of the frame.",
  "description_1": "A close up of a black rhinoceros beetle on the back of a fair skinned person's hand. The rhinoceros beetle is facing towards the wrist of the person with its back in view and legs spread out. The beetle is black with a slight brown undertone and brown legs. It has rhino-like horns on its head and a shiny, reflective coat on its head and back areas. There is a light fixture shining on its back and slightly on the top of the person's hand with a shadow. The person's hand is not fully showing, only three fingers are in view and part of the wrist. The background is a plush beige cover, very blurry. The main focus is the hand and the rhinoceros beetle."
