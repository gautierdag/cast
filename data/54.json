There is a dragonfly standing on the top strand of barbed wire and facing towards the left. Below the dragonfly is a spider web attached to the bottom strand of barbed wire. Behind the dragonfly and barbed wire are several plants and trees with bright green leaves, the ground floor that these plants and trees are rooted into is made up of loose dried up leaves and soil.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor, close up, slightly blurry view of a large fallen tree truck with a body of a long green snake under the log. The log has fallen on its side. The snake's body is heading towards the top of the frame. The ground the snake is on top of is made of rock outcroppings. Dead leaves are under the log. The snake's head and tail are not visible. The upper half of the log has its bark stripped away, exposing rotting wood. The rotting wood is light and dark brown. The snake has a repeating pattern on its skin that resembles a checkered pattern."
