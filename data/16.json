The pillar is off white, there is a strip of white embedded into the middle of the pillar extending from the bottom of the image ending right below the pilaster on top of the pillar. Behind the pillar on the left and right side of the image are rectangular windows extending vertically with gray frames. There is a white curtain covering the inside part of the window on the right side of the image. The reflection of another building and the tops of trees in the bottom left corner of the image are being cast on the windows in the image.",
  "description_1": "A medium-high angle view of a window with five clear windows, each having a different pattern. The top window is an image of an angle facing backwards with two white wings, in a light blue dress, and two people to the right of her in black robes, holding something in their hands. The border of the windows is white with cracks, scratches, and dark brown stains. The window is on a wet, brown brick wall, with light brown bricks in the top left corner. There are black strings hanging horizontally above the mirrors. The word \"Keenan\" in white spray paint, is at the bottom of the windows. Black wires and a silver pole are seen below the word."
