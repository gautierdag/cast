Two curved lines are seen on the top right, these look like backwards Cs, one fitting in the other. They have been drawn in a faded orange color with a small blue mark under the bottom of the smaller C. To the left of these marks is a vertical row of symbols drawn in white chalk that has faded from wear or weather. The symbols are, from top to bottom, a triangle, a circle, a square, and a heart. More unidentifiable markings are seen on the left in white. A dried and cracked gray rubber contraction joint is seen across the top of the image where two concrete slabs meet. On the top right, a small seam runs from the contraction joint down to the right side at an angle. The concrete slabs are weathered and aged, with green growth on them.", "description_1": "A medium-shot of a two tire concrete garden fountain in a loose pebble ground. The bottom tier of the fountains is a round circle, and the top tier is a smaller circle stacked above the bottom circle. A small egg shape object is above the top tier and water is flowing out of the top of the egg into the top tier and finally flowing into the bottom tier. Two green bushes are in front of the fountain in the foreground, and a green plant is partially in view to the right of the fountain. A small green bush is behind the fountain on the left and in front of a light tan fence. A shadow of the fountain is seen in the middle of the fence, and three other shadows of pots are on the fence in the top right corner."}
