  "description_0": "An eye-level view of a tree trunk that has been ripped out of the ground laying on its side. The tree trunk is facing away from view, only the bottom and very top of the tree trunk is visible. The bottom of the tree trunk is hollow, there is a hole visible through the bottom that allows you to see a small sliver of the ground in the distance. The ground is sloped toward the bottom left corner of the image, it is a dirt surface that is covered mostly with gray discolored leaves and brown leaves scattered throughout the image. There are thin tree trunks and trees in the background behind the tree trunk.",
  "description_1": "An overhead view of a group of nine California pipevine swallowtail butterflies sitting on a dirt surface. The butterflies are all facing different directions. The front of their wings are dark blue and fade into a lighter shade of blue as they go back. There are white dots lining the edge of each butterfly's wings. There are two large gray rocks visible in the bottom right and bottom left corner of the image. A large concentration of dry leaves and sticks are covering the dirt surface at the top half of the image. There are sticks and dry leaves scattered more sparingly in the middle of the image where the butterflies are standing."
