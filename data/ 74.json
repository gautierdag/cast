The toad leans over a broken limb covered in gray growth. The toad holds its front legs in, with each of the three front toes pointing inward. The back of the toad is not seen on the other side of the limb. The toad's skin is covered in tiny bumps, the top of its head and its back are orange, with the bottom edge and legs being tan with dark gray spots. The mouth is a large line the whole way across its head, with beige lips. The eyes are lined in dark brown, with a large black center and a pale yellow rim around them. The limb it lies across is broken off directly to the left. The blurred background shows the trunk of a tree, with a dark crack or hole in the center and a sprout of a few long greens hanging down from above.", "description_1": "An outdoor daytime angled down medium close-up three-quarter back left side view of a large brown wolf spider that is crawling from right to left towards the top left corner.
