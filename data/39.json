The clay pot is a rusty orange color with a circular base at the bottom that is filled with water. The plant has purple-green leaves with short stems, and the fibers act to cover the soil. The pot is over a white marble hard surface, next to a corner with ceramic brick walls and a white wooden panel on the right. A partial view of a white light switch is in the top left corner. A soft shadow of the plant casts to the wooden panel."
