  "description_0": "A long distance low resolution daytime view of a yellow train locomotive. The train is heading toward the right and slightly toward the viewer. The side of the engine is a dark yellow. The top fifth is black around the windows. The base of the locomotive is black. A short guard railing is in front of the locomotive. On the other side of the tracks, in front of the engine, is a bushy leafy tree. Behind the tree and to the right of it, a blue modern semi truck sleeper cab is visible. Across the bottom half of the frame is a field of short light green grass. The grass is long and has gone to seed next to the guard rail on the right. The top half of the image is a cloudless blue sky. There is a utility pole behind the middle of the locomotive. Utility lines run to the right and out of the frame, sagging slightly.",
  "description_1": "A distant daytime low resolution view of a locomotive engine car. The locomotive is traveling to the right and slightly toward the viewer. The engine is dark red with a wide yellow stripe down its center. Below the wide yellow stripe, the engine is black. A thin yellow stripe is above the wheels. The top half of a McDonald's building is in front of the engine car and in the background. There is a flag pole with an American Flag at the top of it. It is waving in the wind to the right. Below the American flag is a smaller red flag with the golden arches on it. Across the front third of the image is a dried light green grassy field. The grass is longer and gone to see toward the engine car. A chain link fence runs towards the locomotive from below the middle of the left edge of the frame. The fence slants down and out of view in front of the locomotive. Across the top in the background is a blue cloudless sky. A telephone pole and utility lines run across it."
