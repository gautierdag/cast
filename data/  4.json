It has a white patch on its chest, and its eyes are just dark circles. It is surrounded by Christmas presents on both sides. Part of a Christmas tree is visible on the left and behind the cat. There are white lights glowing on the tree. The wall on the right is bright green with shadows on it. This is a nighttime shot.", "description_1": "An outdoor daytime view of some blooming Zinnia flowers next to a curb. Their leaves are long and narrow, light green, and come to a dull point at the end. The center of the flower looks like a pineapple. Three rows of fuchsia petals come out from around the base of the center. One flower is in full bloom at the center of the left edge of the frame. It leans up and slightly to the right. It is on a long tube of a stem. Above this bloom is a splay of four green leaves with darker green veins. Another Zinnia bloom is on a long stem leaning toward the top center. The left top center of this bloom is cut off by the top edge of the frame. A street curb cuts across the bottom right corner. It is angled from bottom left to upper right. Some weed leaves and grasses are hanging over the curve. A group of dark green variegated plant leaves is in the top right corner. They are leaning toward that corner."}
