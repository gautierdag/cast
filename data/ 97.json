Below the roots in the middle of the image is murky green water. There is a spiderweb that stretches from the root at the bottom of the image to the roots at the top of the image hanging over the water. Natural light is reflecting off of the water on the right side of the image and toward the middle of the image.", "description_1": "A medium-close-up view of a small pond that is crystal clear. The brown, hard ground can be seen underneath the water, and along the ground there is also white spotting. Surrounding the water are thin, white blades of grass. Behind the pond, there are rocks that are white and have small amounts of moss growing on them. The reflection of a tree line can be seen on the right side of the pond. Also on the pond, the reflection of the gray sky can be seen, as it is daytime."}
