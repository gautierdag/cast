The base of the fixture is made up of a silver circle, and attached to the circle is a thin metal pole that runs horizontally. Attached to the ends of the thin pole are four lights that are made of white foggy glass, the glass is shaped like cones. Underneath the glass are light bulbs that are white. Underneath the light fixture, there is a gray wall.", "description_1": "Low-angle, indoor view of two light bulbs, mounted on a wall above a mirror. The lights are arranged in a line, side by side with the right bulb on. The bulbs have a white, slightly opaque shade, with a swirl pattern. The lights are held up by a silver horizontal bar, mounted on the cream wall behind, next to a corner. Below the light is a partial view of a mirror with black borders that cover the bottom-quarter of the frame, the edge of the mirror on the right meets the corner, with the left edge out of view. The mirror reflects an image of the opposite side of the wall. The top left corner is a part view of a window with the clear blue sky in the background, no frames are around the window."}
