  "description_0": "A high-angle shot of a small, all-black bike in the corner of two white walls. The frame of the bike is made of thick metal poles, and the bike is slightly leaning towards the foreground, propped up by its kick stand. A light brown and black air pump is behind the back tire of the wheel on the right and is slightly taller than the back wheel. A small, orange, reflective rectangular strip is on the side of the left pedal. A shadow of the bike is partially seen on the wall behind. In between two white walls is a gray, dirty concrete wall. Black scratches cover the bottom of the wall on the left, and the bottom of a black bike holder hanging on the wall is in the top left corner.",
  "description_1": "A side view of an all black bicycle on a cement surface facing an all white wall on the left side of the image. There is a neon yellow and black helmet hanging from the handlebar of the bike. There is also a black metal rack on top of the back wheel of the bike. The front of the bike is turned to its left toward the bottom left corner of the image. The middle of the handle bar has a black bike lock wrapped around it and a black metal bike rack that is mounted to the white wall on the left side of the image. Paint has been scratched off of the white wall in some areas. There is a gray wooden plank resting against a white wall in the background at the top of the image and the left side of a gray door visible in the top right corner of the image."
