  "description_0": "An indoor slightly angled up close-up three-quarter front left side view of a circular shaped convex mirror that is facing slightly downwards just above the bottom right corner. The mirror has a thin black border and is reflecting four multi-colored cars parked in a parking garage. Within the reflection, towards the bottom right, two of the cars are facing towards the left. Also within the reflection towards the left center, the two other cars are parked facing forward, perpendicular to the two prior cars. The cars are parked on a gray cement floor and in between white painted lines. The ceiling above the cars and above the mirror is made up of cream colored cement. Behind the mirror, around the bottom half, are four white blurred panels placed side by side that have natural light shining through them.",
  "description_1": "Close-up view of a convex mirror showing a wide eye angle of an entryway to a parking garage. The mirror is a round ovoid shape, with a black frame and is placed on a corner of a beige stone brick wall, and is facing to the bottom right. The reflections shown on the mirror are two car entryways, blocked by thin white gates, and a white line separating the paths, most of the area is a concrete surface, and it is directly under the shadow of the parking garage itself. Sunlight casts on the left side of the corner behind the mirror, with a darker shade of beige to the right side."
