  "description_0": "A face-on view of a copper rock fish is seen in an aquarium. The fish is swimming at an angle so that its left side is slightly visible. The left fin of the fish is missing sections, while the right fin is perfectly fine. The fish's black, bulging eyes are caught looking through the aquarium glass as it swims away from a large brown stone and bright green seaweed. Two small slits of bright blue are seen behind the seaweed in the enclosure's background. The bright light from above shines down on the fish to show him off.",

The fish is a light gray color, with patches of darker gray on its back. There is a pink starfish spread on the black rock in the bottom left corner of the image. To the left of the orange starfish next to the black rock are two small open clam shells. There are two other orange starfish on the yellow and white pebbles to the right of the rock in the bottom right corner of the image. There is a brown rock on the floor of the aquarium on the right side of the image, above that rock is another rock placed on an elevated surface."
