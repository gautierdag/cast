A blue plastic bow is in the left hand of the Kurnoth Hunter, and he is standing on an artificial grass base. The Kurnoth Hunter is made of plastic that resembles green and white wood. A gray painted plastic fence that resembles a metal and stone fence with points at the top of the fence is behind the Warhammer figure to the left and right. A cream-colored wall is partially visible in the background above the rest of the board from the Warhammer board game.", "description_1": "A close-up indoor image of a small red resin Chinese dragon is seen on a wood table. The dragon figure has swirls surrounding the base, with its tail wrapped around. The dragon is standing up on its back legs; its right front arm is down, while its left arm is holding up a sphere with its clawed paw. The dragon is looking up to the right with its mouth open, while it casts a small shadow on the table to the right. The unfinished wood table has a black scratch on the left front of the dragon figure. The right side of the table is against a red-painted wall with two white cloth hangings. The further white hanging has black squares with numbers in them."}
