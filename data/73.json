  "description_0": "A close-up view of a cream-colored labradoodle looking through the wired cable railing of a stair set as a black and white cat that is staring back, resting on the first step. The dog has curly cream-colored fur with a red leash is wrapped around its neck, extending towards the middle of the lower edge of the image. The rear half of the dog is out of frame to the right. The cat across the cable railing of the stairs is sitting on the first step with its tail hovering over the floor to the left. The cat has a black patch that covers the ears and forehead and extends over the right eyebrow. The stairs lead up and to the right and have a gray carpet along the middle of the steps. The reflection of the dog rests on the floor below the dog.",
  "description_1": "A close-up shot of the right side of the face of a cream-colored labradoodle puppy looking to its right at the camera and its front paws on the back part of the seat of a wooden chair. A grey tabby cat is to the right of the dog facing the background and looking to its left at the dog on the brown chair, peering under the back rest of the chair. The cat looks anxious as the puppy is perturbing the cat. A brown leather bench with a white base is in the background behind the chair and cat and is seen through the back rest of the brown chair. A hard wood floor with sunlight shining on it extends into the background and is above the dog's head in the top left corner."
