Wavy alto-stratus clouds blend together with cirrocumulus formations. Natural sunlight illuminates the top layer of clouds across the view, with partial shadows visible across the clouds within the view.", "description_1": "An aerial view of a blue sky viewed through a camera placed close up against an airplane window, causing a slight fish eye lens effect around the bottom of the window. The lower half of the sky is filled with fluffy cirrocumulus clouds. The clouds have small gaps in between each individual cluster of clouds. There is a tiny cluster of cirrus clouds on the right edge of the frame, just above the cirrocumulus clouds. A large grass land is faintly visible through the hazy sky. There are some river outlets visible in the upper left corner of the frame."}
