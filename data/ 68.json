To the right and left of the canyon are many tall bushy trees that are bunched together and consist of green leaves. Behind the canyon and trees are more green trees placed on a hilly surface, and built amongst the trees are many multi-colored homes that are spread apart. The sky is a light blue color that gets darker the higher it goes, it is full of large white colored puffy cumulus clouds. Closer up are eight light colored telephone pole lines that are positioned vertically and span from left to right.", "description_1": "An outdoor view of a hillside on a bright, sunlit day. The hill is angled from top right to lower bottom left. The wing of a dark blue kite is seen just over the crest of the hill. It is to the right of the center of the bottom edge of the frame.

The hillside rises to the right and is scrubby and dry with a few tall weed sticks. The background consists of the blue sky with white cumulus clouds scattered across it.
