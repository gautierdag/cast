A lone pigeon is on the corner of the concrete support pillar. The pigeon is facing left and away. He is in the center of the frame. The left half of the image is a pale blue cloudless sky. The right half is the overpass. The bottom right corner is the face of the pillar. It has some rust stains on it that make an animated face, with two dots for eyes, and a horizontal line for the mouth. The top right corner has the concrete support beam for the highway above. It is in the shadows.", "description_1": "Two black birds are seen from below sitting on a power line together, facing the upper right. The birds sit right next to each other on the middle line, the right one is ducking its head down while the left one looks up, showing the profile of its beak. The power lines run diagonally across the image from the upper left to the lower right. There are five lines, with the thickest at the top and each following slightly thinner. The last line has a twisted design to it, while the others are smooth. They all run parallel to each other. The background sky is a solid, dusty gray-blue, with no sunshine in sight."}
