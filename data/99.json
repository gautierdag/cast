  "description_0": "An outdoor view of the underside of a large pier at dusk. The pier is going out straight out to sea from the viewer's perspective. It has tall concrete pillars and struts. The pillars and struts are gray with black water stains on them. The seawater across the bottom of the frame is foaming. As it goes out to sea, it graduates in color to an aqua blue and then a dark blue to the horizon in the distance. The sky is the upper half of the frame. It has pink on the left side of the horizon under the pier. The sky is more yellow at the horizon on the right side under the pier. Dark clouds with precipitation in them are across the top right corner of the frame.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor long shot of the right side of a pier extending out into the light green ocean water. Several people are visible leaning with their forearms on the pier's wooden handrail, looking into the water. Two metal roof awnings are visible along the pier. Light foaming is visible across the bottom where the waves crash along the shore. Large nimbostratus clouds covers the majority of the upper skies. The bright yellow sun setting in the lower right corner, shining on the underside of the distant clouds. Daytime."
