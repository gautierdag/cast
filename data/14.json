There are utility wires extending across the top of the image directly behind the top of the neck of the guitar. There are more utility wires in the background visible at the bottom of the image. Behind the left side of the guitar is a large construction crane extending up and then to the left at the top, extending out of view. Treetops are visible in the distance in the bottom right corner of the image. In the bottom left corner of the image in the far distance is a building and a sky scraper. There is a group of clouds extending across the bottom of the image, the sun is shining behind the clouds in the bottom left corner of the image. There are faint cirrus clouds across the middle of the image, the rest of the sky is clear blue.",
  "description_1": "A medium shot of two acoustic guitars hanging from a colorfully lit-up dark gray wall. The guitars hang on both sides of the center part of the frame, the left guitar is a tan color, while the right one is a light sand color. They both hang from their headstocks on a black wall mount that is shaped like a guitar pick. On both sides next to the guitars are two other wall mounts, with the leftmost empty and the right one having a round instrument with silver bells around it. The left bottom corner shows a portion of a guitar set and a black electronic box with black wires connected to it. On the upper left side, a green light comes from the top of the frame; to the right is a yellow light; and in the upper right corner is a blue light. Each of the instruments casts shadows on the bottom sides from the light above."
