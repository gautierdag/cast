The pier is going out straight out to sea from the viewer's perspective. It has tall concrete pillars and struts. The pillars and struts are gray with black water stains on them. The seawater across the bottom of the frame is foaming. As it goes out to sea, it graduates in color to an aqua blue and then a dark blue to the horizon in the distance. The sky is the upper half of the frame. It has pink on the left side of the horizon under the pier. The sky is more yellow at the horizon on the right side under the pier. Dark clouds with precipitation in them are across the top right corner of the frame.", "description_1": "An outdoor long-shot view of a blue-green ocean. On the near side of the ocean, a lot of white foam can be seen, and along the foam there are gaps. In the center of the ocean, there is a small wave that has foam along the top of it. There is another wave to the far right, and behind the one in the middle, it is the same size but wider. The top portion of the wave is foamy. Along the skyline, a dark gray, cloudy sky can be seen."}
