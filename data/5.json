  "description_0": "An indoor high angle view from the top of a set of wooden switch back stairs can be seen, with two cats both sitting on them. A white cat with a black tail and black spot is closest in view and on the very top step seated and staring toward the bottom of the view. The other cat is seated as well at the bottom of the first steps down, its grey and a tabby cat, it's staring upward toward the white cat. The staircase is decorated with a small Christmas tree, shining with several lights of various colors including blue, green, yellow, red, and orange. The stairways are also decorated with Pinus montezumae plants. Light seems to potrude from the bottom of the view onto the white cat while the gray cat is left in a more visible but still shaded area.",
  "description_1": "An eye level view of a realistic diorama. The diorama has a life size coyote and a life size turkey. The coyote is on the left, while the turkey is on the right. The coyote is coming toward the viewer and is turned toward the turkey as if he is beginning to stalk. The turkey is facing the viewer and to the right with his head and beak up. The coyote is tan, brown, white, and black. The turkey is dark brown with a gray neck and red on top of his head and throat. The forefront of the image has long green reeds that appear to be growing from top to bottom. Dried light tan straw is in front of the coyote. A wall is across the image in the background behind the animals. The wall is painted a green and brown color that is camouflaged well. It creates depth of field and the look of a horizon. The background of the top third of the image is a painted overcast sky."
