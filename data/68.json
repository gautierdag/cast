  "description_0": "A Lamborghini showroom is seen from outside the window, which shows reflections of lights outside. A bright blue Lamborghini is seen in the front, with a silver convertible to the right and a white SUV in the background. The blue car in the front is seen from the front passenger's side, with a white note on the windshield and a large white tag hanging from the rearview mirror. Several small lights are reflected on this vehicle, while the silver next to it shows one large reflection over the front passenger fender. Behind the white SUV is a doorway leading to a lit office. Behind the other two vehicles is a large black window on the left, indicating nighttime, two small racks of t-shirts, and a set of stairs leading up to the right. The flooring in the showroom is made of large concrete slabs.",
