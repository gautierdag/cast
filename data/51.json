  "description_0": "A front view of a brown sign with a white arrow on the top of it pointing to the right. The words \"SHORTCUT\" is written in white underneath the arrow. The letters are running down the sign one letter at a time. The sign is set in an area of dead grass and leaves. A chain link fence is to the left of the sign with tree branches and vines growing over the top of it. A group of cacti is behind the sign in the background next to a dead tree to the right of them. A dirt trail is to the right of the dead tree, along with a tree with brown and orange leaves on the right side of the trail. On the other side of the chain link fence are more trees in dead grass.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor eye level shot of a metal directional sign with a white arrow decal pointing upwards and white vertical letters that read,\"TO PARKING LOT\" centered below on the flat front face of the sign. Light brown wooden logs lay horizontally to the right side, creating a staircase upwards that curves to the left behind the sign. Each log about 6 inches tall, and the steps are about two and a half feet in depth. The top surfaces of each step are red soil covered with piles of soggy fallen leaves. Tall leafless trees are visible in the background to the right and left sides of the walkway. A bright gray sky is visible in the background through the upper tree branches. Daytime."
