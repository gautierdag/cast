The buildings towards the bottom are closer, most of them are several stories high and are colored either a shade of maroon or beige. Behind the group of buildings is an enormous body of water that consists of several boats traveling on it. Behind the body of water is a city environment that consists of tall skyscraper buildings that are mostly the same color due to their walls being made out of window panels. The clear sky can be seen above the skyscrapers, it is a light blue color that gets darker the higher it goes.", "description_1": "A daytime view of the New Jersey City skyline from a skyscraper in Chelsea. The buildings across the bottom third of the image are shorter, older, and browner, than those across the river. A river runs horizontally behind the older skyline in the forefront. Across the river is a more modern city skyline. The buildings all appear taller and more angular. They also appear more wrapped in blue and gray glass. Much of this glass may be reflecting the cloudless sky in the top half of the image. The sky is hazy and brown just behind the newer skyscrapers. Across the top of the frame, the sky is very blue."}
