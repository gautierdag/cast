The house has gray wood panels with white framed windows partially visible. The well-defined shadow of a tree with long leafy branches is seen in being projected onto the camera facing side of the shingled roof. There are multiple trees on the far side of the house with visible tree branches filled with light green leaves above the roofline. There are three thin black electrical lines hanging in front of the singular tree going in a horizontal direction, with a fourth line much thicker seen in the top left corner. The light blue sky is slightly visible through the empty cracks of the tree leaves in the distant background.", "description_1": "A view of a road with a worn out white arrow pointing right and another one pointing left. Beside the left arrow there is a red stop sign on a pole standing on cement. There is dried up grass and big green trees surrounding everything and on the road you can see a truck driving away. The sky is a clear blue color with some white clouds."}
