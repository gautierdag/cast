  "description_0": "An outdoor, close up, bird's eye view of a bench made up of a horizontal rectangular shaped slab of stone and a wooden planked sitting area supported by a small wooden post. The slab makes up the right side of the bench. A small square stone is placed under the left end of the slab to prop it up. The raised planks are on the left end of the bench. The center and right section of the planks are resting directly on the stone slab. Above the bench, there is green grass, and large lush buses. A dirt path is directly below the bench. Sunlight is hitting the left side of the frame.",
  "description_1": "A very old concrete bench is seen on a concrete slab in a grassy area. The bench is in a simple art deco style with rounded layers of end legs and no backrest. The concrete of the bench and slab is weathered and has efflorescence growth in circles all over it. The concrete slab has a large crack off center with tall grass growing in it. The grass surrounding the concrete slab and bench is bright green, thick and tall. There are two shadows, one on each side of the image. Neither shadow has a creator visible."
