  "description_0": "An outdoor nighttime close up view of a limestone brick wall with strings of Christmas lights hanging down over it. The strings of lights are evenly spaced across the wall. The electrical wire is dark. The light bulbs and sockets are all evenly spaced along the wires. The light bulbs are small C6 size, and teardrop shaped. They are opaque white light bulbs. They point in all directions and shine on the wall. The lights create irregular shadows and patterns against the non-symmetrical bricks. Overall, the image produces a golden glow.",
  "description_1": "The nighttime outdoor wide view shot through the tall glass windows of a building with multiple rows of pill shaped pendant lights hanging from its ceiling and illuminating the interior. The center of each pill shaped pendant has a silver horizontal ring with a frosted dome on top and bottom. Cream walls are visible in the background of the interior of the building. The brightness of the inside creates a high contrast of the exterior, where a silhouette of a medium-sized tree is visible to the left on the outside of the building."
