To the right of the rock formation and underneath it, it's completely dark. The bottom portion of the drapery formation is made up of small rocks, and above these small rocks there are drapery formations. To the right of these formations, the glare of the circular light can be seen, and the top portion of it is covered by shade.", "description_1": "A view looking up at the ceiling of a cave. A large dark crevice is on the ceiling. The crevice is wide in the bottom right corner of the frame. It rises and narrows to above the center of the image. On each side of the crevice is the spotlit craggy ceiling. It is red and orange with dark jagged shadows on it. The top middle of the frame shows the ceiling of the cave in more light.
