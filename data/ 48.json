The floor of the cave is dark, and on the right side of it there are white stones that have been inserted into the ground and are rectangular. The near side of the trail is straight, and as it goes, it curves to the left. There is a rock formation on the right that is smooth and brown, while the wall on the left is smoother, and it wraps around, following the floor. In the distance and on the wall on the right, there is a large circular light that is lighting up the smooth wall, and on the ceiling, there are large white lights being reflected onto it. All throughout the cave, there are smooth ridges that resemble circles.", "description_1": "A medium outdoor view of a pumice rock wall with a combination of light and dark gray, white, and tan colors. Light green plants are growing and hanging downward on the bottom surface of the rock and the top left side as well. On the bottom half, there is a land of light gray rock with light green and dark brown plants growing on the rock. In between both rocks is a patch of light green, long Adiantum capillus-veneris plants growing in the center. To the left of that is a black, shadowed hole."}
