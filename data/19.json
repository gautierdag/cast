  "description_0": "An overhead view of two wet footprints, over a stone surface. The footprints display two left feet, with one smaller than the other, being a child's footprint. The foot on the left is larger and has four toes present, with the top and bottom half shade showing. The child's footprint is to the bottom right and presents the whole foot with all five toes shaped in a wet mark. The footprints are over a square stone floor, with small debris present. A ray of shadows and sunlight cast across the footprints from the right edge.",
  "description_1": "A gray curtain is seen covering a window; the curtain is slightly see-through, and the shadow of a cat is seen casting onto the curtain from behind it. The cat is in a side view, facing towards the right. It is sitting down, its head angled slightly down, and its ears perked up. The shadow merges into a semi-circular shadow beneath it, making the tail and back legs of the cat obscured. A horizontal shadow is casting across, running through the top of the cat's head, and is cast from the window behind the cat. The curtain's fabric begins to fold over itself on the right side of the view, and on the left, the seam between one segment of fabric and another can be seen, which is allowing sunlight from the window to stream through."
