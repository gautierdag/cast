On the right side, there are two pallets that are wooden and cream-colored, with the wood going vertically. The dark gray wooden pallets on the left side are broken, and there are multiples stacked on top of each other. The sun is shining down on both of them. On the dry, dead grass to the left, there is a big tree shadow. Skinny, long trees with only branches are seen in the back, surrounded by multiple trees with dark and light green leaves and all different sizes.", "description_1": "An outdoor shot of an old rusted piece of farming equipment and large rusted metal tires sitting in under the shade of a tall bushy tree and becoming overgrown by the tall green grass and weeds from below. Sunlight coming through the branches falls on the exposed spokes of the leftmost tire. The thick bushes and leaves of the surrounding trees create a solid wall in the background. Daytime."}
