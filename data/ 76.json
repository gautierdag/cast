The kitten has its head up and is to the left towards the sun that is shining in. Its white whiskers are sticking out on each side of its head. It has its front left paw out on the floor. Its tail is sticking out and curved laying on the floor in a shadow on the floor next to part of a rug. There are scratches on the wood floor and little pieces of dirt and pebbles around. The sunlight casts shadows on the floor, creating a pattern of vertical, wide louvers.", "description_1": "A top-down view of a gray or silver cat sitting and bathing in a patch of sun. The cat is sitting in a three-quarter view; the cat's body is facing towards the right, but its head is turned to face the camera. The cat's eyes are closed, and it looks like it is enjoying the sunlight. Squares of sunlight from a window are spilling onto the cat and the floor around it, illuminating those spots and leaving the unlit areas shaded. The cat is sitting on a rug placed horizontally that is made of classical geometric designs of maroon, dark blue, white, cream, and yellow. The rug is placed on top of a light wood floor, and the panels are going vertically."}
