  "description_0": "An aerial view of a large body of water with two boats traveling through it One boat is a long rectangular shape, and the other is much shorter and taller. The rectangular boat is at a diagonal, angled towards the right, and directly in front of it is the smaller boat, also at the same angle. Both boats are leaving a trail in the water behind them, which appears much lighter in color. They are in the middle of the frame and appear completely black; no color of our shape is visible due to the perspective. The shot is from very far above, making the boats appear tiny. Sunlight is shining over the water from the top, creating shadows behind the waves. There are many small waves tightly packed together, and the water does not appear to be jagged, only mildly wavy. The water appears as a light gray, and the sunlight is a bright white.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor daytime angled down view from high above, of a black boat towards the bottom center traveling on a large body of dark colored water. The boat is traveling at a forty-five degree angle towards the top right corner. The body of water is completely full of long ripples that are both horizontally and diagonally positioned throughout its surface with almost no space in between them. The sun light is coming into the view from the top left corner and is turning the left half of the water much lighter than the right side. The sun shining on the water gives a look as if the boat was traveling on the lighter part of the water and is now entering the dark colored portion."
