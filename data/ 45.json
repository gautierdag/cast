The light source is coming from a raised off frame light. There is a cream-colored labradoodle on the right side of the lawn with a plastic cone around its neck, and it is looking down at the ground with its tail sticking out to the right. The dog is facing to the left. There is light shining on the dog. The lawn closer to the bottom of the frame is dried and brown. It is nighttime."}
