  "description_0": "A watercolor painting on 3 trees with different color leaves placed on a gray wall with a black base board. The leftmost tree in the painting has green leaves, the middle tree has blue leaves, and the rightmost tree has red leaves. The 3 trees are next to each other. The rightmost tree is only half visible. The trees are planted in wine colored dirt. At the left side of the frame, there are 2 poles wrapped with cloth. The left pole's cloth goes from yellow to blue with a nylon string laced down the side. The right pole's cloth goes from blue to red to gray.",
  "description_1": "A worm's eye view of seven high-profile framed mirrors mounted on a gray pattern wall. Each of the mirrors is framed in either copper, gold, or silver on its sides and extends outward from the wall. Two of the silver and copper mirrors on the left are cut off in the image, while one large silver-framed mirror is cut off to the right. Centered left to right: A small square mirror framed in gold, a long rectangular mirror framed in copper. Below those mirrors is a large square-shaped mirror framed in silver, and to the right is a rectangular mirror framed in gold. The wall's pattern is made up of condensed dots that alternate between light, medium, and dark gray colors. A gray ceiling is above the wall and appears smooth in texture. A small LED panel framed in off-white is pictured at the upper left, and to the right of that is a round gray-beige cover for a fire sprinkler head. A partial reflection of another LED panel is visible in the same mirror. The sprinkler cover is visible again in the reflection of the copper-framed horizontal mirror. The bottom row of mirrors, seen from left to center, reflect pendent light in the shapes of long pink, green, and blue tubes that are lighting the opposite side of the room."
