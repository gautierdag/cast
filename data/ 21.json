The person is fully submerged into the water and is wearing a black scuba-diving suit, there is a small silver cylindrical shaped tank attached to the person's back. The person has their legs spread out with each foot placed against two separate rocks. The person is facing towards a large beige colored boulder rock, and their hands are placed on the rock. The top surface of the water can be seen just above the person's head. There is light shining down into the water from above its surface.", "description_1": "A close up view of a very distorted reflection of a row of trees extending from the left side of the image and ending on the right side of the image. An elevated surface is directly behind the trees. There is a cream-colored stone wall leading up to the elevated surface, each rectangular stone varies in size and shade. In the background on top of the elevated surface is a teal colored structure extending across the top half of the image behind the trees, the distortion of the reflection makes it hard to discern what the structure is. The sky at the top of the reflection and top of the image is clear blue with no visible cloud coverage. There is a gray metal bar extending across the very top of the image."}
