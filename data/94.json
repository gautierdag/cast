  "description_0": "An outdoor medium view of the top of three trees. The tree along the right is taller, and it is filled with dark green leaves. The tree to the left is the smallest, and it is filled with small green leaves, but the tips of some of the branches are empty. To the left of the tree in the middle, there is a slightly taller tree that also has green leaves, but there are more gaps between these trees. Seen through the gaps in these trees is a light blue sky. Above these green trees there is a large gray cloud that runs horizontally, and underneath the cloud and to the right there is a thin, dark gray cloud that runs vertically. Above this large cloud and towards the left, a thin, small cloud is sitting by itself.",
  "description_1": "A downward view of the sky covered in white clouds that obscure the sun; there are two dark gray cumulus clouds, a small one on the left and a larger one towards the right, that separate slightly at the top and are mostly obscuring the sun. Behind the cumulus clouds are altocumulus clouds that stretch across the sky in a rough pattern, separating in some areas to reveal the deep blue sky. Below the sky, a line of trees is visible that dips down towards the left side to create an opening. The scene has high contrast and low exposure, making the sunlight very bright and the trees as dark as shadows."
