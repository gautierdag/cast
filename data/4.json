  "description_0": "Outdoor medium shot view of the General W. K Wilson Jr. Bridge from a 3/4 view from behind the glass of a motor vehicle on the opposite road. There are droplets of water on the glass that are out of focus. There are dark gray rain clouds outside. A bridge arch over a portion of a highway road with suspension cords coming down from the left and right sides of the bridge where the beams cross horizontally on the arch. The archway resembles a silver ladder. Yellow reflective bumpers border the road on the lower right. A cement barrier rises between the arch and just before it.",
  "description_1": "An aerial view of a dark green and gray blue landscape with a river running through it. The image is low resolution and not in focus. The river is wide and runs from the bottom left corner to one third of the way up and out on the right edge of the frame. One tanker ship is traveling in the center of the river to the left and angled to the bottom left corner. A large sand bank bows out from the lower river bank as the river bends to the right. Below the lower river bank is a forested area with many thick trees. A tributary river feeds the main river from the right, and meanders down to the left. Above the far side of the river, a forest makes a large loop and fills the center of the frame. Farm land fills the top half of the frame beyond."
