The bright yellow sun is seen surrounded by clouds just above the building lines between two tall buildings. The sky is filled with fluffy clouds in white and gray. While the clouds surrounding the sun are bright yellow. The tallest building in the view is a dark glass, rectangular-shaped building with very clean lines. There are balconies along the visible end on every level. The glass of this building reflects a cream-colored building on the right. The next tallest building on the left of the sunset is surrounded by balconies and has a rooftop outdoor area. The building is made of metal framing and dark glass. The city view is filled with numerous styles and materials of buildings seen below the sunset in the shade. A bright white rooftop is seen on the bottom edge of the right side of the image.", "description_1": "A medium-close-up view from above of downtown Austin. Closer to the ground and to the left, there are multiple buildings that are brown and made up of bricks and windows. To the right of the buildings, there is a tall skyscraper that is made of glass. To the very far left, there is a white building that is full of windows, the top portion of that building is still being made. On the right side of the building, there is a tall metal crane. The sky is covered in large gray clouds that have white lights shining throughout them. On the far side of the clouds, the yellow light of the sun can be seen."}
