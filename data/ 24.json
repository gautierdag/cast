The egg is a light brown color, facing with its slimmer top to the bottom right, and it is slightly centered in frame. The wooden table is a dark brown color, with a couple dark spots visible near the egg, and the striped patterns move horizontally. The egg's shadow casts to the bottom left on the table, giving it a round shape rather than the ovoid shape.", "description_1": "A daytime look at a stream with a cinder block in it that is buried in the rocks. The overall color of the frame is olive green. This color is from the bottom of the stream. It is covered with rocks of different sizes that are all covered in moss. Really, it's mud color. The cinder block is in the center of the frame. It is on its side with the holes facing up. It is tilted with its top left corner pointing toward the top left corner of the frame. The holes are filled with rocks as well. The bottom right corner of the cinder block points towards the bottom right corner of the frame. The diagonal bottom half of the image is the stream water reflecting the daylight sky. The reflection shows ripples and current from the bottom left corner up toward the middle of the right edge."}
