The back of the jet in the forefront is all silver and one can see the jet engine exhaust holes, as well as the hole on the very back of the fuselage. To the right of this jet is another jet with a red tail that can be seen taxiing to the left. Behind the tarmac in the far background is a large building and a city sky line behind that.", "description_1": "A long shot view over the right wing of a white airplane of two large mostly white airplanes standing on an airport apron. The \"AIRFRANCE\" planes ahead of the \"Delta\" plane both with dark front sides due to the sun high behind. The skies are filled with Stratocumuls clouds that fade from a deep blue down to almost solid white from the clouds."}
