  "description_0": "An outdoor medium view of broken wooden pallets. On the right side, there are two pallets that are wooden and cream-colored, with the wood going vertically. The dark gray wooden pallets on the left side are broken, and there are multiples stacked on top of each other. The sun is shining down on both of them. On the dry, dead grass to the left, there is a big tree shadow. Skinny, long trees with only branches are seen in the back, surrounded by multiple trees with dark and light green leaves and all different sizes.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor medium view of a beige stone stairway going up, towards the light green grassland. There are visible, large, light brown tree roots surrounding the stairway. Four long, tall, dark green t-posts are standing vertically on the left side of the stairway. The first t-post has a white tip on it. The staircase is surrounded by light brown soil, and light and dark green grass patches. Below the staircase, there is a land of light yellow, white, and tan rocks. Some of the rocks, closest to the clear, olive-green creek, are covered in algae. The glares in the water are caused by the reflection of the light blue sky. The grassland is covered by the tree's shadows."
