  "description_0": "A long shot, high-angle view of a big tree filled with dark green leaves and black branches with the sun shining down on it, surrounded by dry, light brown, yellowish grass. The tree's shadow is seen below it on the grass. On the left side, there are patches of light and dark green grass, and some on the right side, across, as well. Small groups of trees with dark and light green leaves are in the top left corner, surrounded by more dead, light brown grass and a few more trees behind it. Multiple dark green leaf trees are seen in the top right corner, in front of a white gravel trail going in a horizontal direction.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor medium shot of a large Ashe juniper tree standing in a field of tall dry yellow grass with other juniper trees visible in the background. The large shadow of the juniper tree falls down to the right from the sunlight high above to the left. The pine-like leaves and branches of the tree are mostly angled towards the upper left, as if the wind is blowing onto the tree towards the left. Two large greenhouse arches are visible in the back left, behind the trees. The sky above the tree line is light blue with slight stratus clouding."
