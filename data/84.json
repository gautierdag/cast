The truck has spray painted a yellow smiley face with \"X\" on each eye in the middle of the truck near the passenger door. The passenger front tire has yellow lines spray painted on it like sun rays. The backside tire has orange swirled lines spray painted on it. The truck is orange, blue, black, and yellow. In the background is a checkered black and white flag and a blue plastic sheet on the wall.",
  "description_1": "A black monster truck is seen in an arena doing donuts on the concrete floor. There is black text reading \"Hot WHEELS\" on the side of the truck, with a yellow background ribbon over orange and yellow flames. The truck has red roll bars through the body, with a chrome accessory in the front partially visible. The rims on the giant tires are red. The blue tarp hanging in the background is wrinkled in waves of movement and has a very small area of the \"Hot Wheels\" logo visible in the top right of the image. The concrete floor has tire marks from the monster trucks."
