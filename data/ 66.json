The can is mostly dark, with multiple rust spots and an opening crack on the left side, it has no top on, to the right of the can is a small cactus with little thorny balls. The cactus has some green stems, with tan spikes straight out in different directions. The objects are over a dirt ground with multiple rocks present and tiny green plants are emerging from the ground near the can and cactus. The background is slightly blurry with a small tree, multiple bushes, and rocks partially visible. A hill covers the background near the top right, and a clear blue sky is partly visible in the top left frame. Shadows from the can and cactus fall to the left.", "description_1": "An outdoor medium shot of two Mojave yucca plants standing in a desert area surrounded by broken pebbles and small tumbleweeds. Shadows of the plant leaves fall directly downwards indicating the sun is high above. Tall buildings of the hotels in Las Vegas are visible in the background on the right, with tall mountains covered with a light haze are visible in the distant background on the left and right sides. The sky is light blue at the horizon line and fades deep blue at the very top. Daytime."}
