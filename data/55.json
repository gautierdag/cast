Past that, there is a rounded area with small buildings and a large building with a white roof. Trees are along the roadway past that on the left going back. Some more buildings are visible on the top left behind the area of trees. The road curves and goes off into the distance, with other roads connecting to it in the middle on the left.

Along the top right side of the land there are two buildings, and to the left of the buildings there are multiple small cars that are parked in large gray parking lots. Along the center of the land, the third building can be seen running horizontally, and in front of the building there are a lot of cars as well. Along the near side of the road, there are two large buildings, the one on the right is square, and the one on the left is rectangular.
