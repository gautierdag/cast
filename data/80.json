  "description_0": "A view of the sky at the beginning of a sunset. The sky fully encompasses the view. The lower half of the frame is bright yellow, which creates a gradient to a pale blue at the top of the frame. White altocumulus clouds cover the top of the frame, spreading horizontally from the top left down towards the bottom right of the frame. Dark gray altocumulus clouds are closer to the frame, covering up the sunlight, which is causing them to become shadowed. They are more horizontally oriented, with the left side becoming more stretched out. Behind the clouds, there is bright white sunlight. The shot is very clear, and the resolution is high.",
  "description_1": "A wide shot of the sunset sky with a long horizontal cirrus cloud that appears dark gray on its left and upper left sides due to the sunset being on the bottom left side. The right side of the cloud appears yellowish-white. The sky appears grayish blue from the top, and gradually turns pale orange towards the bottom. In the pale orange section of the sky are tiny specks of yellow-appearing clouds. At the bottom corner are three black silhouettes of the upper sections of different streetlamps. The far left lamp post has two light casings on each side of its pole, and right next to it is a lamp post that has a curved pole at the top that faces to the left with a light at the end. In the bottom center is another lamp post that has a curved pole that faces to the right."
