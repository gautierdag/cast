  "description_0": "A look down at a silver fire hydrant. The front cap is a larger red circle. The top cap has paint chipping off of it leaving dark gray and yellow coloring. The circular cuff at the base has rusted bolt heads. The dome top has the number \"29\" carefully hand painted in thin black lines on it. The ground surrounding the fire hydrant is void of vegetation. It is brown dirt with small pebbles and twigs. Behind the fire hydrant in the upper left corner is a green-leafed bush. Behind and to the right of the bush is a light stone square fence post. Behind and just to the right of this post is a square tan brick fence post. To the right of the brick post is a tangle of bush branches. A tan brick building wall is visible through the branches in the upper right corner of the frame.",
  "description_1": "A close up view of a rusted silver fire hydrant with an orange bonnet with chipped paint, showing silver underneath, and a rusted silver operating stem nut. There are small metal chains hanging from the side outlets, and a pumper outlet. The bottom of the fire hydrant is covered in dirt and there is a moist area of mud around the base of the fire hydrant. There is a shadow of a person behind it and a shadow to the right of the hydrant. There is a field of grass with some patches missing, revealing dirt."
