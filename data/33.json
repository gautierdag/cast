  "description_0": "A high angle view of a blue velvet sofa placed on a gray and blue rectangular patterned rug floor. The legs of the sofa are black, the seat of the sofa and the back both have sewing buttons that from squares in the sofa. The sofa has no arm rests. It is facing forward. Behind the sofa are glass windows with gray metal frames, the windows go across the entire background of the image behind the chair. Visible through the windows are two buildings, one on the left and the other on the right side of the image. There is a glare in the window due to the focus of the image that makes the things outside of the window hard to identify, but the view from the window is on a higher floor.",
  "description_1": "A three-quarters view of a brown wooden rocking chair with a wicker seat and a wicker backrest facing the top right corner of the image on a gray cement surface. The chair is facing a set of large windows extending across the entire image. Visible through the windows extending from the left side of the image and ending on the far right side of the image is a large skyscraper, the sides of the skyscraper are made almost entirely of glass windows. Visible through the windows on the far left side of the image are four balconies that are only partially in view. There are metal frames in between the large windows in front of the rocking chair that are casting shadows over the surface that the rocking chair is placed on."
