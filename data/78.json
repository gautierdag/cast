  "description_0": "An outdoor closeup view of three neon green street signs. The sign is on a big black metal post. The signs are stacked on top of each other. They all have a neon green background with a black border. The top sign is a diamond shape. It has the black pedestrian icon on it. The icon is facing left. The middle sign is a horizontal rectangle. It has a thick black arrow on it. The arrow is slanted and pointing down and to the left. The bottom sign is a square with the text: \"BLIND / PEDS\". An arm of a traditional streetlamp is reaching out from behind the bottom sign. It arches up and toward the left. It is silhouetted against the overcast sky in the background. The bottom right corner shows the underside of a bus stop roof that is illuminated. There is a green tree top behind the roof.",
  "description_1": "A neon yellow diamond sign with a small black border shows the left side of a black silhouette man walking with his right left forward in the middle of the sign. A smaller yellow rectangle sign with a black border is below the diamond sign and has black text in the middle that reads \"BLIND / PEDS.\" Light grey concrete parking garages are in the background to the left and right of the sign. Power lines are running above the sign on the right, and a turn on streetlight extends behind the sign to the left. The sky is a light blue and it is dusk. Two green trees are on either side of the pole to the sign in the background in front of the parking garages."
