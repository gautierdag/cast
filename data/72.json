  "description_0": "An outdoor extreme long shot of a two bridge highway over a body of water with tall bushy trees on its far left and right sides. Each side of the bridge is two lanes for traffic and a shoulder lane on either side. Two white rectangular signs are mounted to the median of the left shoulder of the right bridge, with illegible black text above the numbers \"55\" and \"60\". Several vehicles are visible driving away on the right bridge and towards the camera on the left bridge. A horizontal line is visible along the bridge where the sun brightly shines onto the bridge from behind a cloud. The sky is light blue and mostly filled with large cumulus clouds.",
  "description_1": "A long view of a highway system taken from the vantage point of a car on the highway. The highway directly ahead extends forward and curves up and out of view as it extends to the middle of the image. There is a highway overpass extending from the left side of the image curving up and to the right of the image passing over the highway directly ahead. There is an exit to the right side of the highway that extends out to the right side of the highway and curves back around over the highway ahead toward the left side of the image. There are streetlights with white posts going along the sides of the highways and exits in the image. On the right side of the image in between the highway and the exit is a green sign with a white diagonal arrow pointing right and white text that reads \"EXIT / 223B\". There is a black sedan, two white trucks, a black truck, a black SUV, and a white eighteen wheeler on the highway ahead of the vantage point of the image. The sky taking up the top of the image is almost completely covered in clouds."
