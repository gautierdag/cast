There are six decorative bushes, all of these bushes are cut to resemble spirals, and in between the bushes are smaller bushes that have been cut into the shape of small rectangles. Along the near side of the view, there is a white staircase that leads down to the bushes. On the left and right sides of the staircase, there are bronze railings. The floor is made up of tiles; along the tiles and towards the center, there are black markings, as well as brown and white ones too; these markings are placed circularly. Most of the area is being lit up by the sun, except for the far right corner of the area. Behind the decorative bushes is a cement railway that is made with extreme detail. It is daytime, and the sun is shining brightly."}
