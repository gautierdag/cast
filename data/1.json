The bridge has a silver metal pole railing on its side, and a partial view of two white vehicles on the bridge driving from right to left. In front of the bridge, on the right side, are several tree branches hanging down and extending out towards the left that have green leaves attached to them. Underneath the bridge, and further behind it, is a small sliver of an opening that shows several crowns of trees placed side by side that all have light green leaves attached to them. Above the bridge is the clear light blue sky. Above the view of the light blue sky, and closer up, is another view of the bottom of a cement bridge.",
