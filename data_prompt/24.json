  "description_0": "A front view of a statue of Esteban de Dorantes at the Texas State Capitol grounds. He is standing on a thin metal platform, has a brimmed hat on and tall boots over his knees. He has a cross around his neck and a long decorative pendant necklace. Not only that, but he has a cane in his left hand and a tall pole in his right with beads hanging down around the top of a gourd-shaped object at the top of it. Behind him is a sculpture of four men on a carved wall. Three of them are facing forward and are all dressed the same. They have long white shirts on and are all carrying buckets in their right hands. They have hats on and are barefoot. On the left is a man standing and facing the right. He has a cap on, short pants and is barefoot. In the background are green grass and trees. The sky is bright blue over the treetops.",
  "description_1": "Low-angle view of a statue of a man on top of a rock. The statue is made up of dark metal, and it presents a man from the older times, based on his attire. The man is posed in a standing up motion, with his right arm raised up above his head in a saluting face, and his left arm crossed behind him. He has a rapier on his left side, holstered, and long leather boots and a metal plate. The statue is standing on top of a white boulder in the bottom-quarter frame, with trees in the background and tan buildings partially visible. Behind the background is a blue sky, with parts of a gray cloud in the middle-right side."
