The paws of the kitten are white, while along the body there are darker marks that run across its body. The tip of the tail is black, as are its eyes. The cat is standing inside a black metal cage. On the bottom portion of the cage, there is a bed where the cat is standing. The bed is a dark gray, while the bedding surrounding it is a light gray. In front of the light gray bedding, there is a blue bowl that is filled with cat food.",
  "description_1": "Close-up, indoor view of a light gray kitten, laying on its back over a white sheet with two hands caressing it. The kitten is facing forward with its eyes directed below and their front paws out close to the frame, only the top half of their body is visible. The left hand is partially obscured, and is placed over the kitten's belly, with the right hand placing their hand next to the kitten on the right, behind the paw. The sheet behind the objects has a straight stitching pattern and light shines over the blanket and kitten."
