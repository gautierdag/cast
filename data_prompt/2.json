  "description_0": "A day time, low resolution aerial view of a marina. The boats are yachts of various sizes. They are all angled slightly in their slips from bottom right to upper left. The yachts all appear to be white in color. The yachts are docked either facing slightly toward the upper left, or lower right. A causeway highway bridge is across the top of the frame. It begins in the upper left corner and declines to the upper right corner. To the right of the marina is the main land, and it is tree covered. There are some buildings scattered amongst the trees.",
  "description_1": "A long-shot view from above of a lake. The lake has three rowing boats, one along the top of the lake, which is going towards the left; another along the middle, which is moving towards the right; and another at the bottom, which is also moving towards the right. All three of them have white accents. Also in the middle and towards the left, there is a white pontoon that is moving towards the right. To the right of the rowing boat that is at the bottom, a large land mass can be seen through the water. On the right side of the lake, there are trees that surround the water, in between the trees, a thin gray road is visible. On the near side of the lake, there are multiple trees, most of the trees are being lit up by the sun and are green. There is one that has orange leaves to the left. Behind the orange-leaf tree there is a white building, and to the right of the building, thin electrical cables can be seen running horizontally."
