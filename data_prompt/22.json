  "description_0": "A medium-close-up view of a brown 18-wheeler driving along the cement bridge. The truck is driving to the left; the front portion of the truck is brown; and it has a silver grill. The windows of the truck are tinted black, and to the right of the driver's window there is a silver muffler that runs vertically. Attached to the back of the front portion of the truck is a long black bed that has small red and white rectangles running along the edge of the bed. The bridge is being held up by two cement pillars, the top portion of the pillars runs horizontally, and attached to it are two pillars that run vertically. Surrounding those pillars is a body of water that has ripples along it. On the near side of the view, there is a cement pillar that runs horizontally. On the other side of the bridge, there is a grass field that is being lit up by the sun. Along the top portion of the truck, there is a light blue sky that can be seen, and to the right, a small white cloud is visible.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor medium view of a highway and two large bridges during the daytime. The main road is going straight, and as it begins to get further, it gets smaller. Along the right and left sides of the road, there are cement railroads. To the left of the road, there is a yellow line that runs vertically, and there is another to the right; both of these lines run firmly, while the lines along the center of the road are spaced out and white; these lines have black lines along the edges of them. Sitting above the road in the middle are two bridges that are highways. The bridge on the near side is taller and is being held up by cement pillars that run vertically, on top of those pillars is another that runs horizontally. Behind this bridge is another that is a highway, and along this highway there is a white car driving. Through the gaps in the bridges, there is a baby blue sky that has small white clouds to the left of it. It is daytime, and the sun is shining brightly onto the highways."
