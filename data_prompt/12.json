The top of the star fish is slanted towards the right. At the bottom of the star fish are very small tan colored grippers that are keeping it stuck to the glass. In the background is a small view of the rest of the tank with an octopus tentacle showing at the bottom left corner and one octopus tentacle showing in the top left corner. There are seaweed and reefs showing in the background and at the top are two cellphone flashlight reflections creating a glare on the glass. There are two small specs of light on the left and right side of the tank.",
