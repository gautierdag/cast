Below is a print of two apartment buildings facing each other. They have a reddish-brown wall with multiple windows covering the entire walls. A bright yellow and white light are reflecting on the wall by an LED sign, the top half is bright yellow and the bottom half is bright green, with a white circle with a black arrow inside on the left side, a red square with the number eight in white in the middle, and the word \"Parking\" in white on the right. A navy blue wall is seen on the right side, with a light glare coming from the round ceiling light in the white ceiling. On the right side of the wall, there is a top print of the corner of the view behind a bridge with a light blue sky. Below that is a print of a black billboard corner with the letter \"D\" in red and white outlining."
