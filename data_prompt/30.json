  "description_1": "A close view of an outdoor game board on a sunny day shows a tic-tac-toe game. The game board is black-painted wood, with a square wood post holding it on each side. The lines for the game are made of thin white wood trim screwed onto the game board. Each square has a peg for the X and O boards to be hung on. The X and O boards are small squares of different colors, there are three orange boards, a green board, and a blue board hanging on the game board currently. Two white Os are painted on two of the orange boards. A black X is painted on the other orange board, and a black X is painted on the green board. The last board is the blue one with a white O painted on it. The background shows sunlit grass with an unidentifiable shape of shade across the background and a black object on the left. The distant background shows metal sheets standing up horizontally on a wood frame."
