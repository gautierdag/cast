To the right of the sign is a wooden platform with multicolored vertical wood planks leaning on the wall; they are red, green, blue, green and yellow. There's overgrown grass going up along its right lower half. To the right of the platform and on the back right corner of the shed is a silver spherical object with a black hole on its top and a white drainage pipe going through it.
