At the bottom right and left of the view other trees are partially visible with green leaves. Large buildings with numerous windows are partially visible behind the trees on the bottom left and right of the view. In the background the blue clouded sky is visible. The tree in the central portion of the image has a very shadowed dark trunk and branches. The view is visible but no bright rays of light break onto the image.",

There are treetops extending across the bottom of the image and a treetop extending up the right side of the image. The treetop on the right side of the image is only partially visible and has leaves on it. The treetops in the bottom right and bottom left corner of the image also have leaves.
