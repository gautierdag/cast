  "description_0": "A high angle view looking down at a group of orange and red flowers inside black pots. The leaves and stems of the flowers are all green. To the right of the flowers is a pile of maroon colored leaves. The flowers and pots are all on a metal shelf. Four more black containers are lined up next to each other on a metal shelf that is above the first metal shelf. Each container has small black plastic pots inside of them. Each pot is filled with soil and flowers. The flowers are red, orange, and yellow. The majority of flowers are orange. A ground area of concrete is below the metal shelves and flowers. The pots are casting shadows onto the concrete.",
  "description_1": "A view of many small cabbage plants in the ground. They have green and purple sagging leaves on them with purple stems. Brown dirt is on the surrounding ground, with broken acorn pieces mixed in with the dirt. The sun is shining on them, and there are shadows on the ground under them to the left. In the middle, set back a bit, a bright green stake is in the ground. It has a pole connected to it on the right and left sides that extends out to each side. There are shadows on the ground from the poles in the back left and right. More plants can be seen in the ground past the stake. The sun is shining on them."
