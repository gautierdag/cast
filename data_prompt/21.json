  "description_0": "A bunch of deer are seen from a distance. They all face towards the left while looking to the side to detect danger. All the deer have the same light brown-to-white ombre fur. They all stand close to a sand trail worn down by hikers or vehicles. The other side of the trail shows a thickly wooded area of dark trunked trees with bright green leaves. The foreground shows small white weeds with bushes in the near foreground. A barbed-wire fence is seen in the foreground. The sun is seen behind the tree line in the distance, like it is just setting or rising while still giving daylight.",
  "description_1": "A long shot outdoor view of six deer in a field with a large row of trees across the view in the upper middle portion of the image. Above the trees at the very top of the view is the light gray clouded sky that almost appears white in color. In the middle of the view are the six deer, a side view of three of them located on the middle left of the view, each of them aligned vertically with the highest deer slightly more to the left and all three of them orientated to the left. Two of the deer are in the middle, with one of them orientated to the left. On the right side of the view one of the deer is grazing by himself with his head facing toward the grass. The view is very visible and the green leaves from the trees are illuminated from light."
