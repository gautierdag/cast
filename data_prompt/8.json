  "description_0": "A close up side view of a Zombie-Wrex toy truck orientated toward the right, landing after a jump. The toy truck is colored cyan while the entire suspension and chassis is colored purple. The image is slightly blurred, from the toy trucks tires to the dried grass located in the bottom right of the view. The toy truck lands on a light colored flat tile stone surface. The view is very visible despite no bright light entering the image. The top of the toy truck is visibly bright on the hood area in the front.",
  "description_1": "A Bone Shaker truck is half lifted into the air, the front tires completely off the ground, and the truck is 90 degrees angled upwards. It's from a side view, allowing a painted skull with a red flame decal on the side to be seen. The truck has crushed several cars, with a yellow sedan being completely flattened on the right, two blue sedans being moderately crushed, and an orange van in the center having the roof caved in. Behind the truck, a blue tarp is covering a wall, and beyond it are rows of audience members watching the show. A red and yellow design is on the tarp, but it is mostly obscured by the truck. The lighting is harsh and is reflecting off the truck and gray concrete below."
