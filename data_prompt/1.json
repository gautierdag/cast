  "description_0": "A close-up of an electrical symbol painted onto a concrete surface. The symbol is black; it depicts a very simplified plug with two prongs at the top and a very short cord that is rounded off at the bottom. The symbol is painted very cleanly, and it has no chipping or marks on it. The surface beneath is painted lime green, and the texture of the concrete beneath can be seen. Several small leaves are scattered around the frame, as well as a dark stain to the middle left and a section of the concrete at the top left that has a water stain. The scene is well illuminated, and there are no shadows.",
  "description_1": "A view of wooden door and cement wall with graffiti art on it. On the wooden door there is a black and white drawing of a side profile face facing right and there is a black beam dividing the face and the back of the head that continues onto the cement wall to the left. The face takes up most of the surface but you see there is some small art around it like in the bottom right corner there is text reading \"JOEC ROCK\" and crown above the black text. There is also a bold black crown drawing above the face art. Both the wall and the floor look dirty and old you can see some green mold at the bottom of the cement wall and the door. On the ground you can see stains and there is some red paint on there as well."
