  "description_0": "An outdoor top down view of a metallic silver fire hydrant with some light brown soil on the base flange. The metallic silver fire hydrant is planted into light brown damp soil with a combination of small white and beige rocks, light and dark gray twigs and sticks, and light green and light brown leaves. Behind the fire hydrant a black metal pole is in the middle and black chains are seen hanging from the right and left of the pole. There are two skinny trees with light and dark green leaves behind the chains and pole in circular patches of light brown soil, and a bigger tree with dark green leaves in the far left, also surrounded in light brown soil. There's an empty parking lot behind the bigger tree and a faded red brick building to the right with a off-white tile sidewalk in front of the building with multiple small, skinny, light green leaf trees. There is a light green grassland surrounding the building.",
  "description_1": "Top-down view of a fire hydrant with a light metallic silver color facing outward toward a gray curb of a street. The curb has neon yellow matte lines painted on it. There are 3 evenly spaced lines running down the top of the curb to the street that is out of sight to the right. The fire hydrant has added height from a large black pipe with copper corrosion that it is attached to.. The large water pipe rises out of the ground and connects the hydrant at its base. A dark green railing barrier is cemented into a portion of the curb next to the fire hydrant on the right. There are clusters of grass growing around the hydrant and at the base of a dark green pole that rises from the dirt part of the sidewalk buffer behind the hydrant to the left. Between the railing and pole, further to the right, is a hearty green shrub with medium-small leaves. The leaves catch the glow of artificial light coming from a light pole that is out of sight overhead."
