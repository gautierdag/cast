  "description_0": "A front view of a curved cement tunnel over a road. A single row of lights is at the top of the middle tunnel. They have brackets extending from them on both sides. They are all on. A car on the right is exiting the tunnel. A car is in the left lane farther out and has already exited. The inside of the tunnel ceiling is lit up near the opening. The light is on the road. It is bright, and treetops are visible in the distance. Wood utility poles are on the left along the road. A reflection is on the bottom left of the image.",
  "description_1": "A closeup, eye level view of the inside of a gray stone tunnel near its end point. A black two lane road with double yellow line down the middle is directly below the tunnel. The road curves to the right and goes off-screen. A small stone barrier borders the left side of the curved road. A natural stone wall overgrown with foliage is behind the left end of the stone barrier. To the right of the natural stone wall, there is a forested area filled with thin tall trees with branches filled with green leaves. Sunlight is hitting the end of the curved road."
