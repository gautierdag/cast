  "description_0": "An outdoor medium long shot front view from Battery Park looking south at a white and black two story ferry boat traveling on a large body of rough water that consists of many small ripples. Far behind the body of water is a body of land that consists of the Statue of Liberty. To the left of the statue are several large white cranes and white structures, and to the right of the statue is a large group of many tall and bushy trees that have dark green leaves. The sky is clear and is a light blue and orange color, the bottom of the sky is light blue and gets more orange the higher it goes.",
  "description_1": "An outdoor long shot view looking northwest from pier 44 at the Statue of Liberty underneath the pink and blue sky. The setting sun creates a bright pink glow in the altostratus covered sky behind the statue, making the camera facing side heavily dark and shadowed. Two bright sun glares are visible, one in the torch in the statue's right hand and the other on the left temple area of the statue. My bushy tree line is visible running behind the statue that is also shadowed and dark. A light shadow of the statue is visible in the foreground across the rippling waters."
