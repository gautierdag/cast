  "description_0": "A front view of a car's dash with a backup camera. There are gray air vents on each side of it. Under it, there is a brown control panel. The camera is showing a residential street. The back of a blue car that is parked on the street is visible. On the left of the street is a grassy area with a sidewalk. A tree is visible, as is a metal fence. On the right, there is a grassy area with trees lining the street. A white fence can be seen. Through the front windshield of the car, a house is visible on the right. It is green with a black roof. There are trees behind it and on the left of it. The sun is shining on the treetops.",
  "description_1": "A close-up shot of the right side mirror of a dark gray car. The mirror is centered in a dark gray, glossy casing. The mirror shows a reflection of the right side of the car on the left and an out-of-focus view of a distant large highway bridge and a grass field on the right. At the bottom of the mirror is a black text that reads \"OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE / CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR\" To the right of the mirror is blurry green grass, and on the top is a partly cloudy sky with a blurry utility pole on the top right with wires."
