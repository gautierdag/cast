  "description_0": "A partially visible medium three quarter view of a black and white spotted horse with a white and black mane and tail. The horse is facing toward the right with a brown iron horse hay feeder in the foreground partially obscuring the view of the horse's head. Shadows are cast mainly in the bottom left of the view stretching toward the middle and right of the view. In the background a metal rail fence can be seen from the left to the right around the horse, and numerous trees and bright leaves are visibly illuminated by the sunlight coming from the left side of the view.",
  "description_1": "A rear three quarter view of a black and white spotted horse orientated toward the right. The mane and tail of the horse is a combination of black and white. The head of the horse is white in color, and pointed downward toward eating grass. Behind the black and white horse is another partially visible brown one, with blue colored leg wraps around its two visible legs. Both horses are standing in an area of green and dried grass with a long fence visible behind them stretching across the view. In the background behind the fence, numerous large trees with bright green leaves can be seen. Light illuminates the image, shadows can be seen underneath the black and white horse, and also under a partially visible rusted metal construct in the bottom left of the view."
